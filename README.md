Introduction
This project involves analyzing data from the "Rate My Professor" website. The objective is to understand the patterns and factors that influence professor ratings.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about professors, their departments, schools, and ratings provided by students. 

Key features in the dataset include:
school: The name of the school where the professor teaches.
department: The department to which the professor belongs.
professor_name: The name of the professor.
rating: The overall rating given to the professor by students.
difficulty: The difficulty rating given to the professor by students.
num_ratings: The number of ratings the professor has received.
would_take_again: The percentage of students who would take a class with the professor again.
online_class: Whether the class was online or not.

Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Machine Learning Model

Key Findings
Ratings Distribution: Most professors receive high ratings, with a few outliers receiving very low ratings.
Department Influence: Certain departments tend to have higher or lower average ratings.
Number of Ratings: Professors with more ratings tend to have more stable and reliable average ratings.
Difficulty and Ratings: There is a negative correlation between the difficulty score and the overall rating, indicating that students tend to give lower ratings to professors they find more difficult.
Would Take Again: A high percentage of students willing to take a class again with a professor is strongly associated with higher overall ratings.

Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors that influence professor ratings on the "Rate My Professor" platform. Departments, difficulty, and student willingness to retake classes are significant predictors of overall ratings. The linear regression model developed in this project can be used to predict professor ratings based on these factors.
